            This page was inspired by a <a href="https://twitter.com/whitep4nth3r/status/1510568114966171649">tweet from
                Salma</a> . Pretty HTML only pages are difficult to make well, and accessible. But here we are. I'm
            trying
            my best.

            The key to a lot of this is leveraging using tables with a <span>role="presentation"</span> attribute to make decorated
            sections without css. If you view source on the page, you'll see that there are a LOT of tables. The table
            tag
            typically is used to display tabular data and should NOT be used as a layout method. However, since I am not
            allowed to use CSS, I am pretty much exclusively relying on tables for this purpose. The presentation role
            tells
            the browser to not expose the table and its tabluar children in the accessibility tree. This will make it
            easier
            to navigate for assistive technology.
            <p>
            <p>
                I'm also leveraging some deprecated HTML elements from HTML 3.2 that you should never use. In order to
                be
                "compliant", I've added the HTML 3.2 doctype at the top of the page <br>
                <span>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"&gt;</span> <br>
                This helps give a hint to the browser that we are going to use some older stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
                HOWEVER, I'm also using some newer things such as <span>details/summary, section, main, header, and footer.</span> So
                I'm
                just making a mess of my doctype and what I should be actually using!
